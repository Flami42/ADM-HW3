 **Goal of the homework**: *Build a search engine over a list of movies that have a dedicated page on Wikipedia.*
 
 The repository contais:
* `collector.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect our data from the `html` page (from which we get the urls) and Wikipedia.
* `collector_utils.py`: a python file that stores the function we used in `collector.py`.
* `parser.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to parse the entire collection of `html` pages and save those in `tsv` files.
* `parser_utils.py`: a python file that gathers the function we used in `parser.py`.
* `index.py`: a python file that once executed generate the indexes of the Search engines.
* `index_utils.py`: a python file that contains the functions we used for creating indexes.
* `utils.py`: a python file that gather functions we need in more than one of the previous files.
* `main.py`: a python file that once executed build up the search engine.


We are sorry the rest of the homework is missing. This is because the third element of our group left us in the middle of the homework and had not enought time to do what was meant to do according to ouer possibilities. 
We hope the rest of our code is as clear and as readble as possible. Thank you.
