 **Goal of the homework**: *Build a search engine over a list of movies that have a dedicated page on Wikipedia.*
 
 The repository contais:
 * `collector.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect our data from the `html` page (from which we get the urls) and Wikipedia.
* `collector_utils.py`: a python file that stores the function we used in `collector.py`.
* `collector.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect our data from the `html` page (from which we get the urls) and Wikipedia.
* `collector_utils.py`: a python file that stores the function we used in `collector.py`.

We are very sorry that the rest of the homework is missing. This is because the third element of our group left us with nothing in the middle of the homework and we had few time and not enought pre-knowledge to do what was meant to do. We hope at least our code is as clear and as readble as possible. Thank you.
